<tr><td colspan="9"><h2>Education of Nepal</h2><p>Nepal entered modernity in 1951 with a literacy rate of 5% and about 10,000 students enrolled in 300 schools.[citation needed] By 2017, there were more than seven million students enrolled in 35,601 schools.[250] The overall literacy rate (for population age 5 years and above) increased from 54.1% in 2001 to 65.9% in 2011.[5] The net primary enrolment rate reached 97% by 2017,[251][252] however, enrolment was less than 60% at the secondary level (grades 9 â€“12),[253] and around 12% at the tertiary level.[253] Though there is significant gender disparity in overall literacy rate,[5] girls have overtaken boys in enrolment to all levels of education.[253] Nepal has eleven universities and four independent science academies.[250] Lack of proper infrastructures and teaching materials, and a high student-to-teacher ratio, as well as politicization of school management committees[254] and partisan unionization among both students and teachers,[255] present a hurdle to progress. Free basic education is guaranteed in the constitution but the programme lacks funding for effective implementation.[256] Government has scholarship programmes for girls and disabled students as well as the children of martyrs, marginalized communities and the poor.[257][258] Tens of thousands of Nepali students leave the country every year in search of better education and work, with half of them never returning. </p>
